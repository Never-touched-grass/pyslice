# CONTRIBUTING

## What to Contribute
Please contribute things that help this project, no jokes please. Do things like improve the performance or refactoring things that could be easier to implement.
## Where to Contribute
Please only contribute to the Rust source files, because the samples and markdown do not need improvement as of now.
